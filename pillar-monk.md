# Pillar Monk

Pillar Monks are guides and mentors, dedicating their life to their students and followers.  They are often found serving as the backbone of an army or of high rank within a guild.  In combat they stand their ground and reinforce others, or lead a party through enemy lines with their mighty staff.

## Pillar of Defense 

Beginning at 3rd level when you become a Pillar Monk, your quarterstaff becomes such an extension of your body that your presence is like that of a larger being.  You treat quarterstaffs as if they had the reach property, and you can use the deflect missiles feature when an ally within 10 feet is hit by a ranged weapon attack.  If you reduce the damage against an ally, cannot catch or throw the missile.  Your quarterstaff can also be used to increase the distance of your long and high jumps by 5 feet.  Additionally, you can spend 1 ki point to cast *shield of faith*.

## Pillar of Insight 

At 6th level, your ki grants you knowledge of everything you touch with your hands. As an Action, or when you hit with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to gain knowledge of the touched creature or object, as if sensing it with your choice of detect evil and good, detect poison and disease or identify. The cost increases by 1 ki point for each spell you wish to sense with beyond the first.

## Pillar of Guidance 

After 11th level, your physical prowess is fully matched by your training and discipline.  You  can choose to use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for your attack and damage rolls this turn.  Allies who saw you hit with an attack while using this feature can choose to add your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) to one attack roll they make before the beginning of your next turn.  After you use Pillar of Guidance, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

## Pillar of Focus 

When you reach 17th level, you can channel ki into your staff as a conduit for others.  As an Action you can spend 3 ki points and slam your staff up right onto a flat surface.  It stays there for up to 24 hours generating an aura of ki energy.  It cannot be damaged or moved unless you are unconscious or dead, or you use this feature again ending the effects.  Choose a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier you can see.  They gain access to your ki pool and ki powers while within 30 feet of your staff, but can spend a maximum of 1 ki point per turn.
