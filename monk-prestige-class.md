# Monk Prestige Class

Characters of all classes and races can become monks; all it requires is the right mindset, a desire for self-perfection, and the correct background.  In order to qualify for the Monk Prestige Class, your character level must be 7 or greater, your Wisdom, Dexterity, and Charisma must each be 13 or higher, and you must devote a year of training time to the monastery.  In return, you learn amazing unarmed combat skills, Ki abilities, and a place of honor and respect in society.


Each successive level gained as a Monk requires a period of reflection at the Monk's home monastery before the new abilities are gained.  The length of time depends on the monastery and level, but should be at least a month per Monk level.

### Meditation

Your training has minimized your need for sleep.  Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconsious, for 4 hours a day.  After resting in this way, you gain the same benefits as from a long rest.  This is similar to the elven trance ability; if you are an elf, you only need to meditate for 3 hours a day to reap the benefits.

### Ki-Empowered Strikes

Starting at 2nd level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

### Martial Arts Maneuvers

Starting at 2nd level, the following combat maneuvers are available to you in combat, each costing 1 Ki point.  Your DC for saving throws is 8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier.
* Once per turn, on a successful hit, the target must succeed in a Strength saving throw or drop their weapon.
* Once per turn, on a successful hit, the target must succeed in a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* Once per turn, on a successful hit, the target must succeed in a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the current round.
* You can take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
* You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action on your turn.
* You can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Deflect Missiles

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attacl.  When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.  If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.  You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missle counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a ling range of 60 feet.

### Stillness of Mind

Starting at 3th level, you can use you action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Wholeness of Body

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to heal yourself.  As an action, you can regain hit points equal to 1 HD per monk level, at a cost of 1 Ki point per HD.  You must meditate before you can use this action again.

### Evasion

Starting at 4th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* spell.  When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Purity of Body

Starting at 4th level, your master of the ki flowing you through you makes you immune to diseease and poison.

### Tongue of the Sun and Moon

Starting at 4th level, your learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages.  Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.


### Martial Arts Master

At 5th level, you become a master of martial arts, and your skills are legendary.

* When not wearing armor or shield, AC = Dexterity bonus + Wisdom bonus + proficiency bonus
* Your special combat maneuvers are all available at no Ki cost.  You can still only perform one per round.

### Diamond Soul

Beginning at 5th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, when you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.
