# Monk

This take on the monk is my attempt to remove the Kung-fu movie influences and pseudo-eastern flavor.  This monk seeks to master themselves and become one with the world; along the way, they learn to harness their internal energies and master their body and mind.

## Class Features

As a monk, you gain the following class features:

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per monk level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per  level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** None
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, scimitar, shortsword
- **Tools:** Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument
___
- **Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Wisdom
- **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Medicine, Religion, or Stealth


#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a Shortsword or *(b)* any simple weapon
- *(a)* a Dungeoneer's Pack or *(b)* an Explorer's Pack
- 10 darts


### Martial Artist

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:

* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
* You can make multiple unarmed strikes per round.
* The damage dealt by your unarmed strikes starts at 1d4 and increases with your monk level.

Certain monasteries might use specialized forms of the monk weapons.  For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).  Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in chapter 5, "Equipment."

### Meditation

Your training has minimized your need for sleep.  Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconsious, for 4 hours a day.  After resting in this way, you gain the same benefits as from a long rest.  This is similar to the elven *trance* ability; if you are an elf, you only need to meditate for 3 hours a day to reap the benefits, although your monastic vows might mandate longer daily meditation periods.

### Monastic Vows

As part of their training and initiation, monks adopt certain monastic vows, as dictated by their monastery. These vows are in effect for all monks from that monastery, and are chosen or approved by the DM.

Example vows include:

* Monks must always dress in the clothing of the monastery.
* Monks must shave their heads and beards.
* Monks must not cut their hair, beard, or fingernails.
* Monks must meditate daily.
* Monks must practice their martial art daily.
* Monks must maintain a vegetarian diet, and cannot eat meat.
* Monks must beg for their food.
* Monks must take vows of chastity, silence, and/or poverty.
* Monks must not intentionally take life.
* Monks must not touch money.

These vows are in place for flavor and role playing, and generally don't have game effects, although they can. For example, the distinctive clothing worn by a monk might garner them respect and favors from villagers, which could translate as advantage on Persuasion checks, or a restriction against killing might affect the monk's ability to partake in certain types of quests.

### Unarmored Defense

When not wearing armor or shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity bonus + Wisdom bonus.

### Ki-Empowered Strikes

Starting at 2nd level, you start to learn to channel your Ki.  Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

### Wholeness of Body

Through your training, you gain the ability to heal yourself.  As an action, you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your monk level per Ki point spent.  You may do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before you are required to meditate.

### Martial Adept

When you reach 3rd level, your ongoing mastery of Ki grants you special combat maneuvers.  These manuevers are triggered by spending Ki points, and are detailed at the end of the class description.

### Abilty Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Deflect Missiles

Starting at 5th level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack.  When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by your damage modifier + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.  If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.  You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missle counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a ling range of 60 feet.

### Aura of Serenity

Starting at 6th level, you radiate serenity and equanimity, and your allies benefit directly from it.  Friendly creatures within 10 feet of you get a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Wisdom bonus, and cannot be frightened.  You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

### Evasion

Starting at 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* spell.  When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Martial Master

At 9th level, you become a master of martial arts.

* When not wearing armor or shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity bonus + your Wisdom bonus + proficiency bonus.
* Your special combat maneuvers are all available at half the normal Ki cost, although you can still only perform one per round.

### Stillness of Mind

Starting at 10th level, you can use you action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Transpersonal Sympathy

At 11th level, you can extend your Ki outward, and heal others.  As an action, you can heal another creature of 1d8 + your monk level per Ki point spent.  Like Wholeness of Body, you may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before you are required to complete a meditation session.

### Tongue of the Sun and Moon

Starting at 13th level, your learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages.  Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

### Purity of Body

Starting at 14th level, your mastery of the ki flowing you through you makes you immune to diseease and poison.


### Diamond Soul

Beginning at 15th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, when you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

### Martial Grandmaster

At 17th level, you become a grand master of martial arts, and your skills are legendary.

* When not wearing armor or shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity bonus + your Wisdom bonus + proficiency bonus x 2.
* Your special combat maneuvers are all available at half the normal Ki cost, and you can perform one for each attack.

### Empty Body

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become Invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have Resistance to all damage but force damage.

### Timeless Body

At 20th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically.  You can still die of old age, however.  In addition, you no longer need food of water.

## Martial Arts Maneuvers
