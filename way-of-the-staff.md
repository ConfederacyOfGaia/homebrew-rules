# Way of the Staff (Monk Tradition)

## Staff Control

Beginning at 3rd level, you learn how to fight with a quarterstaff as if it was an extension of your own body. This gives you the following abilities:

* In your hands, a quarterstaff has both the *finesse* and *reach* properties.
* In your hands, a quarterstaff makes unarmed strikes for the purposes of other class abilities.
* When wielding a quarterstaff, you can add your proficiency bonus to your deflect missiles roll.

## Staff Acrobatics

From 6th level on, you learn how to use the quarterstaff to move around more nimbly.  When wielding a quarterstaff, you can add twice your proficiency bonus to Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, and as a bonus action you can use it to propel you into the air, making a high jump of your Dexterity modifier x 5 feet, or, if you have moved at least 10 feet this round, a long jump of your Dexterity modified x 10.

Additionall, when making a Push action to push someone prone, you may use your Dexterity (Acrobatics) in place of Strength (Athletics).

## Spinning Top

Starting at 11th level, you learn how to swirl and spin yourself and the staff as a part of your attacks.  By spending an action and 3 ki points, you can make an attack with your quarterstaff at each creature within 10 feet.  Each creature that is hit must make a Dexterity saving throw.  If they fail, they are knocked prone.

## Zone of Control

From 17th level, your mastery of the quarterstaff is complete.  You can use the martial arts damage die for the quarterstaff, and it gives you a reach of 10 feet at all times.

Additionally, your reaction time becomes almost instantaneous.  When you make an opportunity attack with a quarterstaff, it no longer spends your reaction.  However, all opportunity attacks at the first deal no damange.  Anyone hit by your opportunity attack with a quarterstaff is rendered prone.
